# Binary-Converter 1.0
A program that converts text into it's binary equivalent.

Every single computer, at its bare-bones, runs off of binary--a series of 1's and 0's. If you are interested in what binary looks like, try out this program. Using this program, type in numbers, words, and phrases to find their binary equivalents. Hopefully you can find as much enjoyment in this as I did.
